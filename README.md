# Udemy-Python-Course---Milestone-Project-1
First milestone project on Udemy Python course.

Code had already been 'completed' for the purposes of the online course, now going through the proces of re-writing the code, to show my work method on Github, but also to improve and streamline my initial project now that I have hopefully leant more. More use of classes, functions and a better 'DRY' approach.
